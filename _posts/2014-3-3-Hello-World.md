title: Hello World!
---
This is going to be an almagamation of my thoughts and perspectives as I finish out my undergradate experience, and beyond. Like all pretentious people, I claim my interests to be somewhat eclectic, but I hope to summarize or discuss one scientific article a week, one philosophical or literary idea a week (my aim, for Summer 2017, at least, is to drag myself through Virginia Woolf's "To the Lighthouse", Fanon's "On Violence" and other interesting essays and texts), and to discuss my progress throughout the MD-PhD application process and my summer research experience. I hope that I can use some of this work to satisfy funding requirements as well.
